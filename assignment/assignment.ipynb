        "   - This paper is about data tidying, a framework for data cleaning that eases the process of making messy datasets \"tidy\", allowing for easier manipulation, modeling, and visualization of data.\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "   - It is intended to facilitate exploratory data analysis, and make it simpler to develop data analysis tools that function well together.\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "   - The first sentence means that every messy dataset is considered messy for a different reason, while tidy datasets are tidy in a standardized way. Some messy datasets are messy for one reason, and other messy datasets are messy for a different reason. With tidy datasets, however, they have been standardized in a way that makes them structurally alike. The second sentence is saying that it is easy to understand what parts of specific datasets are observations/variables, but hard to generalize these terms into definitions that can be applied to every dataset.\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "   - Values are the quantitative or qualitative data stored in a dataset, which belong to a variable and an observation. A variable contains the values measuring the same attribute, for example temperature or height. An observation on the other hand, contains the values measured on the same unit, for example, a person, day, or race.\n",

        "   - - Each observation forms a row\n",
        "   - - Each type of observational unit forms a table\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "   - The Five Most Common Problems with Messy Datasets Are:\n",
        "   - - Column headers are values, not variable names\n",
        "   - - Multiple variables are stored in one column\n",
        "   - - Variables are stored in both rows and columns\n",
        "   - - Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table\n",
        "   - - A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables\n",
        "   - The data in table 4 are messy because multiple variables are stored in one column. Both income and frequency are being stored in the same columns.\n",
        "   - Melting a dataset is essentially turning columns into rows. In the example of table 4, melting the dataset would mean turning income and frequency into two distinct columns, and putting the income column names into rows.\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "   - In table 11, column headers are values, not variable names. d1, d2, ... are values of date, not variables. Table 12, however, is tidy, because the days have been turned into values, and now each column stores just one variable. Table 12 is also \"molten\", because the dataset has been melted, with the days columns being turned into rows.\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "   - The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data is that tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data, if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it.\n",
        "   - Wickham hopes that other will build on his tidy framework in an effort to create better tools and data storage strategies. He hopes that methodologies from other field can be used to improve our understanding of data analysis cognitively in order to improve the design of data analysis tools."
